1. Declarative Paradigm

- Modules are defined declaratively, not traditionally
- Python models contain core logic
- XML files define views, menus, and configurations

2. Module Structure

- `__init__.py`: Imports models
- `__manifest__.py`: Module metadata, dependencies, and load order
- Models: Business logic implemented through class methods
- Views: Defined in XML, describing UI and interactions

3. Module Loading

- Addons folder is a shared directory
- Modules must have a validÂ `__manifest__.py`
- Odoo scans addons when updating application list
- Modules appear in available apps but aren't automatically installed
- Manual installation required through web interface or command line

4. Key Characteristics

- Highly configurable through declarative definitions
- Minimal imperative code
- Framework handles much of the underlying implementation

5. Module Import and Model Registration

- Only top-level models need explicit import in init.py
- Auxiliary models within the same file don't require separate imports
- Helps prevent circular import issues
- Odoo's ORM handles model registration during module loading
6. Dependency Management

- Modules are isolated by default
- External module functionality accessed via depends in manifest
- "base" module provides core ORM and system infrastructure
- Explicit dependencies ensure required functionality is available

7. Configuration and Metadata

- XML files transformed into database records
- Key configuration tables include ir_model_data, ir_ui_view, ir_menu
- Module installation process: database schema first, then XML parsing

# ORM Model related information 

In Odoo, self is an ORM recordset that provides powerful methods and attributes:

- Record Navigation
    - self.ids: List of database IDs
    - self.ensure_one(): Ensures recordset has exactly one record
    - self.browse(): Navigate related records

- Database Operations
    - self.create(): Create new records
    - self.write(): Update records
    - self.unlink(): Delete records
    - self.search(): Find records

- Field Access
    - self.field_name: Access field values
    - self.mapped(): Extract field values
    - self.filtered(): Filter recordset
    - self.sorted(): Sort recordset

- Environment and Context
    - self.env: Access Odoo environment
    - self.env.user: Current user
    - self.env.company: Current company
    - self.with_context(): Modify record context

Methods starting with _ in Odoo have special meanings:

- Constraint Methods (like _check_down_payment):
    - Automatically called by Odoo's ORM during record creation/modification
    - Decorated with @api.constrains
    - Raise ValidationError if constraint is violated
    - Do not return values, they either pass silently or raise an exception
    - Triggered before database write operations

- Typical use cases:
    - Validate field values
    - Ensure data integrity
    - Prevent invalid record states
    - Provide custom validation logic beyond basic field constraints

Non-Underscore Methods in Odoo:

- Business Logic Methods
    - Triggered by user actions or UI buttons
    - Defined in model classes
    - Can modify record states and perform complex operations
    - Interact with related records using self.env and relational fields
    - Typically named with action_* prefix
    - Invoked through:
        - UI buttons
        - Programmatic calls
        - Workflow transitions

- Characteristics
    - Can modify multiple records
    - Use self.write() for record updates
    - Can raise UserError for business logic constraints
    - Scope determined by the model's view context
    - Cross-model interactions require relational fields
    - Can contain any arbitrary python code, for instance, API calls.

# Additional Odoo Model Insights

## Field Types and Decorators
- Common Field Types
    - Char: Text fields
    - Integer: Whole number fields
    - Float: Decimal number fields
    - Date: Date fields
    - Many2one: Relational fields linking to another model
    - One2many: Reverse relationship of Many2one
    - Many2many: Complex multi-record relationships

- Decorators
    - @api.depends: Trigger computation of fields
    - @api.constrains: Define field-level validation
    - @api.onchange: React to field value changes

## Model Inheritance
- Inheritance Modes
    - _inherit: Extend existing model
    - _inherits: Delegate inheritance
    - Allows modification and extension of core Odoo models

## Computed and Related Fields
- Computed Fields
    - Dynamically calculated based on other fields
    - Can be stored or non-stored
    - Defined with @api.depends decorator

- Related Fields
    - Directly reference fields in related models
    - Automatically update when source field changes

## Security and Access Rights
- Record Rules
    - Define domain-based access conditions
    - Control record visibility
    - Group-based permissions

- Access Control
    - Field-level security
    - User and group-based restrictions
    - Configurable through XML security rules
